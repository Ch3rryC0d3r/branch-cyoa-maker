## ✨ What is Branch?

Branch is a standalone tool that lets you build branching narratives visually, without needing to write complex code. It combines a node-based editor with a powerful logic system, allowing you to create dynamic stories with variables, conditions, inventory, and even sound effects. When you're ready, you can instantly playtest your creation right inside the app.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Editor Controls

| Action | Control |
| :--- | :--- |
| Pan Canvas | `Middle Mouse Drag` or `WASD` |
| Add Node (Quick) | `Right-click Canvas` → `(Quick) Add Node` |
| Add Comment | `Right-click Canvas` → `Add Comment` |
| Select Node/Comment | `Left-click` |
| Move Node/Comment | `Left-click + Drag` |

### Leaves: The Core of Your Story

Each choice in a node is called a **Leaf**. A Leaf is a single line of text in the "Options" box in the inspector, structured with four parts separated by `|`.

```
Text | Next | Condition | Actions
```

Examples:
- `Take sword | 5 | has_item:key | add_item:sword`
- `Attack | 10 | stamina>5 | @stamina-=5; randr(damage:1,6)`
- `Explore | 2 | | play:steps.wav; delay:500; goto:3`
- `Treasure | | | weighted(Loot, Gold=70, Gem=30)`

👉 Full list of actions is documented in [Leaves Documentation](Leaves.html).
