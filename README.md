## ✨ What is Branch?
Branch is a **visual editor + runtime** for building interactive *choose-your-own-adventure* stories (CYOAs).  
It gives you a **node-based editor** with drag-and-drop tools, variable support, inventory systems, and playtesting — all in one app.  

💡 *Think Twine but Python/Tkinter-based with RPG-like systems built in.*
